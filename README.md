# ESPNOW-MPU6050
In this project, using the one-way scenario of ESP-NOW protocol, we will send the values of MPU6050 module including x, y, z to the destination board. In other words, with a remote ESP board, we send information to another board by moving the acceleration and gyro sensors in space.
